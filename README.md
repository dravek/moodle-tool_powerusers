# Power users generator [![Build Status](https://github.com/dravek/moodle-tool_powerusers/workflows/moodle-plugin-ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dravek/moodle-tool_powerusers/actions)

This generator uses the Marvel API to generate users from your favorite characters in your Moodle instance.

To generate a user just type the name and press the button. The user will be automatically created in your Moodle instance. This user will be created with the name, profile picture and description.
By default the password for all generated users will be generated randomly, but you have the option to add your own password manually.

You can get your own keys for free signing up at https://developer.marvel.com. All characters generated by this plugin are property of Marvel.
